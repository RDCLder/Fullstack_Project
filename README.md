# Trender



Trender is a social media and content aggregator platform inspired by the popular website, Reddit. Initially conceptualized as a Reddit with modified and/or expanded features and a more modern UI design, Trender provides a platform where users can create communities to discuss specific, related topics and comment, share, and vote on content of interest. Trender's hope is to help bring the online community a little closer and let users set tomorrow's trends today.
