# Fullstack Project

## Project Ideas

### Practical/Useful

- Platform for connecting people looking to learn new professional skills or learn how the actual process of beginning a professional career from education to industry is like to actual professionals who can provide insight and mentoring.
    - Erick's idea
    - Look into how Thinkful's data science bootcamp works
        - They connect aspiring data science students with actual professional data scientists

- Reddit/hackernews hybrid
  - See [this React and Node clone](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/9g8xxm/i_made_a_reddit_clone_with_reactjs_and_nodejs_for/)
  - Need it addresses
    - Hackernews is a well-curated community
    - Reddit's biggest pitfall is the lack of quality content because of the "hivemind" mentality that downvoting encourages.
  - My approach
    - Have upvotes and downvotes available by default
    - Allow downvotes to be reserved to those who meet a certain karma/seniority/other metric threshold like Hackernews
    - What other features could be improved upon?

- Open source journal for hosting scientific papers
  - Look into the layout and logic for websites like elsevier, sci-hub, etc.
  - Look into EU's zenodo.org
  - How do you rank credibility/prestige?
      - Is there an ELO system that we can use like PageRank?
  - arxiv is apparently good for tech
  - Can we use blockchain for this?

- Unified ride-hailing platform for:
  - Cars
  - Scooters
  - Bikes?
  - Other?

- Recipe Platform with version control and image recognition
    - Use git to allow users to make branches/clones of recipes and iterate upon them
        - Keeps track of different versions to allow for better experimenting
    - Have user accounts so users can save and upload recipes
        - Allow users to save ingredients and anything else that might be relevant
    - Be able to filter by ingredients available, by category, whatever else might be relevant
        - Potentially kitchen tools/equipment (e.g. air fryer)?
    - Use image recognition to be able to recognize separate ingredients
        - Consider [Food](https://clarifai.com/models/food-image-recognition-model-bd367be194cf45149e75f01d59f77ba7) API
        - Provide ability to upload images/video.

### Just For Fun

- Maybe a combined games app that offers:
  - Card games (e.g. Blackjack, Texas Hold 'Em)
  - Rubik's Cube generator (see below)
  - Sudoku generator (see below)

- Rubik’s Cube with customizable dimensions
  - Provide algorithmic solution if player requests it
  - Provide moves necessary for shortest path
  - Provide challenges like solve within x moves

- Sudoku with non-square patterns
  - Sudoku has 9 3x3 squares, but what if those shapes weren’t squares?
  - They would still have 9 total spaces for filling 1-9, but they could be an irregular shape like a 2x4 rectangle with an extra space attached somewhere.

## Schedule
